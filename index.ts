// How to use array in typescript
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[]=['Atif', 'Ali', 'Ayaz','Wajid']

// Loop through each name in the array.

for (let name of names) {
    // Print a personilize message for each friend 
console.log(``)
}
